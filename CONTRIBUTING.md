The [developer documentation](http://www.mantidproject.org/Category:Development) has information on how to participate in the mantid project as a developer. This document is meant to outline the steps for contributing to mantid without becomming a developer.

 1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository.
 2. Make changes as you see fit. Please still follow the guidelines for [running the unit tests](http://www.mantidproject.org/Running_the_unit_tests) and the [build servers](http://www.mantidproject.org/The_automated_build_process).
 3. Before submitting pull requests email mantid-help@mantidproject.org, and a developer will set up a branch that you can submit pull requests to.
 4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to this branch.


Hints to make the integration of your changes easy:

- Don't forget your unit tests
- All algorithms need documentation, don't forget the .rst file
- Contact us before creating the pull request
- Don't take changes requests to change your code personally
